## Overview and Origin

**copy.ai** was incorporated November 1st 2020 by Paul Yacoubian and Chris Lu.

copy.ai originated from an AI tagline generator called tagline.ai, which was solely focused on creating taglines. After the product gained popularity, the co-founders decided to rebrand and expand it into Copy.ai, transforming it into a versatile platform with a suite of tools designed for a broader range of use cases and greater flexibility in the go-to-market sector.

As of August 2024, the company has had two rounds of funding totaling approximately 14 million dollars. The latest round of funding, October 2021, was a round of series A funding worth 11 million dollars.
